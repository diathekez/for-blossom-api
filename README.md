# For Blossom API
This API pulls up quotes from books (fiction, nonfiction, poetry) that I've read and reminds me of my fiancee.

**Link to project:** https: CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Express, Heroku, & Postman

I built this with vanilla JS using VSCode and the built-in Git Bash terminal. I used Postman to test it before pushing it to Github and deploying it on Heroku.

## Optimizations

In the future, I'll add a "newsletter" option so my fiancee could subscribe and get daily emails with a quote. Perhaps if some people like it, I'll add OAuth to enable account creation so users can input their own quotes.

## Conclusions

XXXXXXX IN PROGRESS
